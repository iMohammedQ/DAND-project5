# Visualizing Bay Wheels Data (02-2020)

## Dataset

Bay Wheels is a regional public bicycle sharing system in California's San Francisco Bay Area. It is operated by Motivate in a partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. Bay Wheels is the first regional and large-scale bicycle sharing system deployed in California and on the West Coast of the United States. It was established as Bay Area Bike Share in August 2013. As of January 2018, the Bay Wheels system had over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose

In June 2017 the system was officially re-launched as Ford GoBike in a partnership with Ford Motor Company. After Motivate's acquisition by Lyft, the system was renamed to Bay Wheels in June 2019. The system is expected to expand to 7,000 bicycles around 540 stations in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville, and San Jose


This dataset have 432354 trips in February - 2020 and can be found on https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data 



## Summary of Findings

**1.Univariate**: The method of paying. Most the clinets prefare using the mobile application then afterthat they using the classic way from kiosk then few clinets using clipper card as is shown from the dataset. then I find hour usage during day and find that the clinets have most number of trips at 8 AM and 5 PM. after that the usage of riding bike during the week, the works day are slightly more than the weekends day. But when we split all the days during the whole month, it shown as that the the wokrs day have more than usage than the weekend but because the first day in February have nearly 20000 clinet. the last thing is the user type, I find that we have subscribers do more trips than customer during this month (Feb 2020).

**2.Bivariate**: Here I wsa fouse on comparing between subcriber and the customer. first I check the method of rental access and I found that the subcribers prefare using the mobile applicathion rahter using the old method with few members using clipper card. On the other side, most the regular customer using the old way from kiosk screen rather than using the application and very few using clipper card. In the usage of bike, I found that in the daily hour, week day and during month that the subcriber are have more trips than customer. Then I compare between weekends and work days, and I found that The usage of riding bike during day, most clinets most use it between 7 AM to 8 PM. but in the workdays they mostly use the bikes in 8 AM and 5 PM and that. But in the weekends the usage start from 7 AM and start growing to 2 PM then start decreasing to 2 AM.

**3.Multivariate**: I start with the usage of the bike for both Subscriber and Customer during the day and comparing between workday and weekend. Subcriber and the customer are using those bike in same hours. For the subscriber, In workday the peak time that have the most trip was in 8 AM and 5 PM and the weekends was from 7 AM to 8 PM with peak in 2 PM. The regular customer, In workday the peak time that have the most trip was in 8 AM and 5 PM and the weekends was from 9 AM to 5 PM. Then the usage of the bike for method of rental access during the day and comparing between workday and weekend. There wasn't big diffrance between workdays and weekends only in the old method using kiosk in work days is was more than the weekends. Then The count trips of user type for method of rental access and comparing between workday and weekend, also no big diffrance between workdays and weekends only in the old method using kiosk in regular customer is slightly more in the works day than the weekends.



## Key Insights for Presentation
 
 
My presentation is foucs on what is my clinets. If they are subcriber or customer. during my exploration, I was looking first about the rental access method to see what is the best way to pay. Then see about the time usage and how effect the hours and weekends during month. After I find these I want to compare between subscriber and customer in rental access method and usage of those bikes. Because These data is very important if we want to inves our budget to enhance our application or using a third party company like Clipper card. Also is it effect the time that using those bikes during weekends or working days.
